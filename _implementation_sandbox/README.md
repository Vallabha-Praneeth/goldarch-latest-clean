# Implementation Sandbox

This folder contains all implementation work for the features outlined in `File_Review_Complete.md`.

## ⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE
**NO FILES OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER MAY BE MODIFIED**

All development work happens here in isolation.

## Folder Structure

```
_implementation_sandbox/
├── CLONED/        # Cloned copies of existing files (preserved structure)
├── NEW/           # Completely new files/components
├── MODULES/       # Independent feature modules (skeletons)
└── NOTES/         # Planning, manifests, verification docs
```

## Purpose

This sandbox enables:
- Safe, non-destructive implementation
- Modular, independent feature development
- Pausable/resumable work across AI sessions
- Clear separation from production code

## Implementation Strategy

Features are built as **independent skeletons** that can be:
- Developed in isolation
- Reviewed independently
- Continued by different AI models
- Integrated only when ready
