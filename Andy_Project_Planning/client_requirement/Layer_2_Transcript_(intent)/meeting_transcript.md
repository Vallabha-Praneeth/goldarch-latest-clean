# Layer 2 — Meeting Transcripts (Intent)

## Purpose
This layer captures **raw client intent** through verbatim meeting transcripts. These transcripts represent what the client said they want, NOT proof of what was shown visually (that's Layer 3).

## Important Rules
- Transcript = what the client says they want
- NOT proof of what they saw
- Timestamps preserve context and emphasis
- Translated from Telugu to English

## Contents
This file contains the complete translated, timestamped transcripts from both client meetings.

## Transcript

- **00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000** If we give them access and start it, that would be better, right? Yeah. That's how I want to do it. Okay. Basically, this framework is initially just for you. Okay. For you to take care of.
- **00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000** But like you said, if you give access to someone, you will find everything in it. You will find everything and give access to them. We can do that. This is actually a website for you personally. Exactly. I know, I know. I'm just explaining the options to you. And like you said, whatever you say. Actually, there are already suppliers for all of these.
- **00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000** If you want to clean everything, if you want it to be fresh, if you want it to be in a certain format, that format will also work. Okay, okay.
- **00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000** So, Praneeth, what he's asking, you can actually give a form, right?
- **00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000** If he clicks on this, he can give a form and his admin people can also enter only those. Yeah. See, there are ad suppliers here. Yeah, these are the ads. See. Here, we will choose a category. We will give categories. We can enter the name, contact person. These are the fields, in general. Do you want more fields than that or that's sufficient? We just need filters in this. Without filters, filters... Drop down lists so that they can select from them. Is that right? No, no, not that. So, go back to the list of suppliers we already have. Let's say, now already kitchen... Now, I have to give only kitchen suppliers to Joy. Okay. For Joy Login, I have to give only kitchen suppliers. Okay. That's not China, I have to give only US. So, here... Okay. No, I have to filter now. At least, I have to search. How do I search here in search suppliers? Rather than going... I just want to add... Yeah, yeah. Generally, what I mean is... I understood what you said. For one minute, I will share it with you. So, this is like our app, right? If we go to suppliers in this, actually, we have filters here. So, we will implement those filters there too. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Wait a minute. Now, let's say... Tomorrow morning... See, the idea is... If I hire somebody from India, right? I want them to start sending quotations to China. Like you did last time. Last time, we did the first level of... First leg of work, right? What is the second leg of work? I will give you the dimensions for the door. I will give you the specs and everything. Now, I want you to send email to all these. Eventually, I will rate them. Yeah.
- **00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000** If I want to write a rating or my notes, I will write the notes. I will say, Hey, Praneeth, can you send quotations to all of them? I will outsource all the procurement from India. So... Okay. Then, he doesn't need all the evals, right? Then, I will give only one door. Okay. Like that. Now, that filter needs to be logged in. Okay. Let's say... For those who worked in the US, Now, in China, this is like the hard work data, right? Yeah. Now, if he doesn't want to give the data in China, I should be able to set up a filter and he can see the data in China from the suppliers. Like that. Oh, yeah. That's it. That's it. So... Yeah, I will do one thing. Or... I will do two things. One is the list of categories... Major... Categories... Subcategories... I will list out all the groups in that in Excel. Okay. And then... Cost... Templates... I will try to put everything there in the Excel sheet. Okay. And then... Probably, let me send that to you. Then, you will get a clear idea. In the meantime... I think... You already have the supplier information. You can just... Even if you don't have it, you will know if you saw it online, right? That supplier... Do that. Okay. Whatever... Okay. Whatever... Uploading the document... Uploading the drawing... And... Generating an auto... An auto quotation... Let's do it as a... Separate project. Okay. Okay. That... Okay. Let's do it in two parts. This is the first part. Otherwise, it will end easily. If that ends... I... I can start adding the stuff. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So... In the app... This is also... Like... Which one is this? Well, it's called... Like we... Typing something. Right? Yes. We did it. Okay. We also did the general template. Okay. So... for the... Payment terms like... Project name. Or just... Ah... Change the place folder. Ah... To send. Without typing or anything. Again... We have done some... Templates as well. Like... Follow-up meeting request. Thank you. Quick reminders. Quotations. Hmm...
- **00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000** If you give a format when you give access to it, whoever you are, you can outsource it and give a contact to China.
- **00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000** We will integrate the templates that they need to give and how to tell them.
- **00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000** Okay, okay, perfect, perfect, yeah, yeah, it's so easy to go dark. I had a letterhead land done with a quotation I call on. Yeah, yeah.
- **00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000** Yeah, it'd be procurement done lost the invoicing quotation.
- **00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000** I mean, I'm going to raise a quotation on the financial table also. Okay, yeah. So yeah. So I'll give you the headings. After that, you just change the names. We've done it.
- **00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000** Maybe a color category or a sequence of numbering category will do. Okay. So you could tablet or business. It's a big idea on the dashboard. I don't have the idea. I don't know. I would like to do it. I think what I like to do it is after you. I know there's a little bit you know or other. Use system. Okay, okay. Yeah. So that's good.
- **00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000** Excel, low sheets, 9-column, sir are behalf templates to much. Stay. Niku. Okay? Okay. so that we can make a list of them. Or if you already have enough functionality, then we can think about data and all. Because first, we'll put the features in, and we'll put some example data, and we'll see how it is functioning. If you are satisfied with that, then we can go for the data upload of all that. Yeah, yeah. Data upload is not going on. Even now, it's the same. Yeah, so as next steps, you send this list of categories and subcategories, and any more supplier info which needs to be uploaded. That's all right. Yeah. Yeah, let me share something. Hold on. OK. OK. Reading is recording. OK. So Praneeth, so now this is there, right? Can you see my screen? Yeah, I can see you. Yeah, so this is Sage and what we are trying to achieve. And at a bigger level, he has done it. OK. So now, I'm going to show you. OK. OK. So you can see, I'm going to show you. So if I show you right now, you can see this, right? Yeah. You will do project, right? Project sale assigned. OK. Who is a person, what is the bid, action items, total invoice amount. It is just a dashboard summary at a project level. If you click this, I will go to that project. OK. So you see, all these are groups. This is a small logo, but you can understand.
- **00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,960** I understand its construction, its operations, its invoicing, its messages etc. So, for each project level, at a high level. Now, see, there is a pre-construction, right? Yeah. I will share the link. I will create a group in WhatsApp and add it there. Okay.
- **00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:48,960** So, if you see here, in pre-construction, you will see Estimates, Takeoffs, Organization, Lead Management, and Bid Management. Okay. In this, the sub-topic is Procurement.
- **00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,960** Whoever estimates it will have access to this Procurement tab. Okay. In Finances, Okay. In Finances, Job Costing. What is Job Costing? In other words, we are bidding, right? If the final bid is approved, it comes to the Job Costing. After removing the process. So, these are generic reports. The existing data will be reported. We can do it at the next level. Payroll, we don't want to mix it here. The cost part will be included in the Finance. You got it, right? Pretty straightforward. Yeah. What is Work in Progress?
- **00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:40,960** So, based on the progress of the work, they will update whether it is 10%, 20%, 1st payment or 2nd payment. Based on that, the reports will come. Okay. Monthly reports or whatever.
- **00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,960** After we enter the projects, it will show you the templates. So, what is the operations side? Project Management, you know, Access. Property Management, I don't want it here. Service Operations and Project Management is not required. It is the project management basics. It will be enough. Okay. Something like this, I will give. But these are the main groups. Okay.
- **00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960** In that, subgroups like Pre-Construction, Finances and you can call it as Operations or Construction. So, what is this? You are doing it. I don't know if Joy showed it to you or not. It is a website called Akanda. Have you seen it? Yes. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.
- **00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:46,960** It means like at a high level, at a very high level, there is Real Estate, there is Construction, there is Investment Management, Asset Management and like any rentals.
- **00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,960** We are working in these two categories, Real Estate and Construction. Okay. Eventually, I want to build an Investment Management group. These are the major parent groups. Okay. If you go under Construction, you will get it like that.
- **00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,960** Investment Management means, now you are a group of, I mean, I will tell you everything overall like what you need to complete. Okay. The second leg is, now I will send it here. Just see this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- **00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:09,960** There will be a monthly progress. Imagine if you invested in a project in Hyderabad, they will show you the progress updates every month.
- **00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:19,960** We create a login for investors like that. They can see the progress of the work without emailing any of our notes.
- **00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:30,960** You can see sample reports. These guys are the best in the industry basically at a master level.
- **00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960** After that, asset management is property management. I don't want to do that. Real estate is a feasibility study. Feasibility study. Yes. Whether it's doable or not. Okay. So, let's take that down. Okay.
- **00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:07,960** A client's conversion from the lead to the customer will take place here. After that, work will take place here. Ongoing projects management will take place here. Assets, operations, rents will be collected here. Rent collection and maintenance will take place here. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- **00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:57,040** and it has too many features but it just gives a sample and I think I have some

What he is doing is, the difference between him and him is that he doesn't read our data. He sends proposals and when he sends proposals, he uses AI and gives us your path estimates. If someone pays you for this activity, you will get a color. Work in progress reporting is the same. These are I think he has completed his free trial. Anyway, so progress building means percentage complete. Let's say, if a quotation is 10,000, you will get advance for 2,000. If it is the first milestone, you will get 2,500. There will be a pending later. There will be a 5% retainage at the end. You will get to know whether he paid or not. Okay. So, if you want to I think you need to go through this. So, you will have a clear idea. This is all in your mind. This is just a classification. That's all. Okay. This is also the same thing. This is the book. This is he has automation. As I said, you can select for 3 days. Hey, you know what? I have internal automations. If someone doesn't pay me, if you send it to them every Thursday, it will automatically go. Honey books. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. yeah the on Tarwatha you're cutting the final dashboard report samples the the final dashboard report samples the final dashboard report samples but but but yeah yeah yeah it's yeah it's not yeah it's not a yeah it's not a big yeah it's not a big deal big deal big deal once yeah it's not a big deal once you have the big deal once you have the big deal once you have the data you look at the dashboard data you look at the dashboard data you look at the dashboard up up up up yeah yeah ok ok
- **00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:51,580** Yeah, but this is not necessary, but I just want to share because it is in the same lines. If those reports are still there, I will send it.
- **00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:36,580** If there is a client database in this, the client database will be software. Yeah, I sent it. That's it. Yeah. Same thing. Everything is the same.
- **00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:02,580** But if you take a look at it, you will understand what the situation is. Okay. Click up. Now this one. This one is using AI more than everyone else. So near him. Wow. Everyone. Sheets. So something like this will come. That's it. If you. If you don't see if I can log in. Yeah. We'll see you later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Now you can see that it is the same as the previous one. He added the notion in it.
- **00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,580** If you add procurement, he will automatically give the templates. But this is not what I want. I just want to show it to you. Just for knowledge. Because of your interest. I have created a template in it. So, I think... If you add spaces... We can give engineering like this. We can give like this. How important it is, how hard it is, etc. Everything else... He went to the next level. Yeah. Engineering team building. But... In construction project management... This guy is... Yeah.
