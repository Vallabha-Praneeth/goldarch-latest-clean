# Layer 3 — Visual Evidence Index

## Purpose
This layer provides **visual ground truth** through screenshots captured during client demonstrations. This is what the client SHOWED on screen, with timestamps linked to meeting recordings.

## Important Rules
- If it was NOT shown on screen, it does NOT belong here
- If it was shown but NOT verbally demanded, it remains a non-binding reference
- Timestamps link to exact moments in meeting recordings
- Each screenshot is catalogued with: timestamp, URL, description, significance

## Relationship to Other Files
- **visual_evidence_index.md** (this file): Flat chronological list of ALL screenshots
- **visual_evidence_overview.md**: Narrative organized by reference system (HoneyBook, ServiceTitan, ClickUp)
