# 🏛️ Layer 3 — Visual Evidence (Observed Systems)

## Purpose of this Layer

- Capture what the client showed
- Based on screenshots + URLs
- Serves as visual ground truth
- Does not convert into requirements automatically

## Rule

**If it was not shown on screen, it does not belong here. If it was shown but not verbally demanded, it remains non-binding reference.**

## 3. ClickUp — Internal Operations Reference (Primary)

**Observed via:** Authenticated workspace walkthrough

**URL:** https://app.clickup.com

**Screenshots:** Items 10–47

*This is the most extensive visual reference in the meeting.*

### 3.1 Workspace & Navigation Structure

**Observed:**
- Multiple Spaces (Procurement, Construction, Waterfall Management)
- Nested hierarchy: Space → Folder → List → Task
- Persistent left-side navigation

**Visual proof:** Items 10–16, 40–42

**What this proves:**
- Client understands hierarchical work organization
- Separation of concerns by domain is important

### 3.2 Task, List & Status Management

**Observed:**
- Task lists with: Status (Open, In Progress, Closed), Priority, Assignee, Due dates
- Grouping by status and subtasks

**Visual proof:** Items 12, 15, 29, 33, 34

**What this proves:**
- Status-driven workflows are familiar to the client
- Task-level accountability is visible and expected

### 3.3 Gantt & Timeline Planning

**Observed:**
- Gantt view
- Task dependencies
- Weekly timeline
- Simple vs complex project schedules

**Visual proof:** Items 27–31

**What this proves:**
- Client understands timeline-based planning
- Dependencies and sequencing matter in construction projects

**What this does NOT prove:**
- Client requires Gantt in v1
- Client prefers Gantt over list/board views

### 3.4 Documentation & Knowledge Management

**Observed:**
- Docs embedded inside workspace
- SOPs stored as structured documents
- Tables inside docs (category managers, thresholds)
- "How to use this template" guidance

**Visual proof:** Items 13, 18, 24–26, 35–37, 43

**What this proves:**
- Documentation lives inside the system, not outside
- SOPs + operational rules are first-class artifacts

### 3.5 Procurement & Supplier Structures

**Observed:**
- Procurement space
- Master Supplier Directory
- Category management tables
- Spend thresholds
- Supplier records as structured entities

**Visual proof:** Items 14, 17, 35–40, 41

## 4. What Layer 3 Explicitly Does NOT Do

This layer does not:

- Decide feature scope
- Justify implementation
- Define priorities
- Convert visuals into requirements
- Assume "they want exactly this"
